#Week 8: CSS Preprocessing with SASS

Here are some links for resources from this week's lecture.

* Scout, the app for compiling SASS to CSS, is [here: ](https://scout-app.io/)
* If you can't get Scout to run for some reason, use your code editor's package manager to install a built-in compiler. For Atom, I recommend [sass-code-kit](https://atom.io/packages/sass-code-kit).
* The official SASS quickstart guide, which covers most of what I covered in the lecture, is [here.](https://sass-lang.com/guide)
* More thorough explanation can be found in the SASS [documentation.](https://sass-lang.com/documentation)
* Additionally, here are some articles I sourced for today's material:
  * [7 SASS Features You Should Be Familiar With](https://www.netguru.com/blog/7-sass-features-you-should-be-familiar-with)
  * [Controlling Color with SASS Functions](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/controlling-color-with-sass-color-functions)


For this week's homework:
1. Create a new project from scratch containing an index.html file. Put whatever markup in there you choose. Don't worry about content- this can be placeholder elements, like I used in today's lesson.
2. Style your HTML using SASS. Your SASS should include:
	* one base stylesheet and one partial stylesheet.
	* At least one property should be stored as a variable.
	* Use colors and experiment with SASS color functions such as lighten() or darken().
	* Create at least one mixin.
	* **Bonus:** write a custom SASS function. This can be very simple.
